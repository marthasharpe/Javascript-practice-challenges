# FreeCodeCamp Practice

### JavaScript challenges and algorithms.

I used this repo to do the challenges for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification through freeCodeCamp.  
It was helpful to be able to play with the code in VSCode and see the output in the console.  
I can also use it as notes to reference in the future.
